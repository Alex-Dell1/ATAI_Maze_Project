\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
Although many have already been offered in Section~\ref{sec:exp},
we would still like to add some more conclusions regarding the approach
that the system required with respect to the tasks.\\
Many of the times, the three systems required completely different approaches
to solve the same problems encountered on the way. This was particularly evident for ILASP, since,
differently from HYPER and Metagol, it is based on ASP. This is further proven when
considering the learning of predicate \texttt{reach/2}, as the paradigm of Answer Set
Programming makes this task extremely trivial and almost useless in the context of
Maze solving.\\
On a bright side, these differences in approach allowed us to better understand our
systems and exploit their traits. As for Metagol it immediately highlighted how powerful metarules can be for
time performances when used correctly, which is not a trivial thing to do when there is no
initial idea on how the final result should look like. As for HYPER and ILASP, it was possible to exploit
their more general approach as they do not require any metarules, although a lot of attention is required
when defining the examples given the sensitivity these systems have with respect to both positive and negative ones.
