\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:perf}
In this section we will offer some conclusions on our works, mainly by comparing them. We deemed important
to compare HYPER, Metagol and ILASP from both the points of view of the performances and the approaches used
to tackle the Maze problem.

\subsection{Performance Analysis}
Table~\ref{tab:prf_cmp} offers an overview of the timings of the main tasks presented in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.

        \hline
        Task & \textbf{HYPER} & \textbf{Metagol} & \textbf{ILASP} \\ \hline
        \texttt{adjacent/2} & 175.884 & 0.056 & 4.767 \\ 
        \texttt{move/2} & 0.063 & 0.047 & 5.343 \\ 
        \texttt{move/2} (\(7*7\) grid) & INSERT & 0.054 & INSERT \\ 
        \texttt{reach/3} & 1.577 & 0.027 & NA \\ 
        \texttt{move/2} and \texttt{reach/3} & 16.585 & 0.848 & NA \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

}
These timings allow us to conclude that the two grid dimensions used (\(5*5\) and \(7*7\)) had no impact on the task being learned.\\
The three systems also share the same behavior when put in front of \emph{combined learning}. In fact, all three systems have shown to perform 
far better when learning one task at a time than when learning more of them together (\texttt{move/2} and \texttt{reach/3}).\\
Table~\ref{tab:prf_cmp} also shows a strong difference in performances between HYPER and Metagol. Given their similar approach, one could expect
to also have similar performances. While HYPER uses a more general approach, Metagol owes its efficiency to metarules and the way they shape the language bias. This, though, does not come
for free, since defining good metarules requires a very accurate initial idea of what the final solution should be like.\\

Lastly, Table~\ref{tab:ex_cmp} shows the differences in execution time when using more positive examples than the minimum required. Metagol shows a slight 
increase in computation time. This could be explained by the fact that Metagol needs to prove more positive examples, even though it has already
found the right hypothesis.

\subsection{Learning \texttt{reach/3} with \emph{tail recursion}}
Being \emph{"solving the Maze problem"} part of the title and one of the main goals of this project, we were
quite surprised that the \texttt{reach/3} predicate learned in our implementations was not able to find a path
in our Maze (Figure~\ref{fig:our})
