\section{Outline}
In this document, we intend to describe our Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) solutions to the Maze problem.\\
Section~\ref{sec:intro} offers a brief illustration of the Maze Problem we have been working on,
including the main choices and assumptions we made.\\
Section~\ref{sec:back} lists the tools we have used to reach our goal.
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Our work is focussed on the Maze problem. This problem consists in finding a path from point \texttt{A}
to point \texttt{B} in a labirinth-like shaped map (see Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}). A variety of classical algorithms
can be used to solve this problem, starting from the most na√Øve wall following algorithm to more complex and elaborated
ones exploiting graph theory concepts.\\
By approaching this simple problem with ILP though, it is possible to extend it into a much more sophisticated and interesting
problem. For instance, it allowed us to start with the assumption that the problem's main character (the
one we shall refer to as \emph{agent}) has no knowledge about \emph{how} to move. Consequently, before even trying
to solve the Maze, the agent needs to learn what a \emph{move} is and then what a \emph{legal} move is.
